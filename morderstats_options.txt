  --sources-file SOURCES_FILE
                        The file containing the data to compute
                        prediction regions with

  --method METHOD       The method for producing quantile regions.

                        Can be one of the following methods:

                        mahal: uses mahalanobis
                        distance to produce regions

                        halfspace: Uses halfspace
                        peeling to produce regions

                        naive: Naively peels off
                        convex hulls to produce regions
  --write-file WRITE_FILE
                        The name of the file to write
                        the convex sets which
                        define the regions

  --write-directory WRITE_DIRECTORY
                        The name of the directory which will contain the
                        written files and plots

  --alpha ALPHA         The alpha level for the prediction region
                        If it is unspecified,
                        it will produce every hull for
                        alpha=.01-.99.
