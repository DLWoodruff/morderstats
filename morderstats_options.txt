optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --sources-file SOURCES_FILE
                        The file which contains the data
  --method METHOD       The method for producing quantile regions.Can be one
                        of the following methods:mahal: uses mahalanobis
                        distance to produce regionshalfspace: Uses halfspace
                        peeling to produce regionsdirect: Directly peels off
                        convex hulls to produce regions
  --write-file WRITE_FILE
                        The name of the file to write the convex sets which
                        define the regions
  --write-directory WRITE_DIRECTORY
                        The name of the directory which will contain the
                        written files and plots
  --alpha ALPHA         The alpha level for the prediction region If it is
                        unspecified, it will produce every hull for
                        alpha=.01-.99.
  --use-pyhull          If this option is set, then the program will use the
                        implementation of the halfspace algorithm which is
                        dependent on pyhull. If it is not set, it will try to
                        use the scipy implementation
